## About

When working on roles, it's a good idea to have common nomenclature,
follow common styles and adopt common practice regarding documentation,
community engagement, maintenance, support, _etc_.

## Motivation

This repository expresses the consensus view of the [EGI Operations team](https://www.egi.eu/internal-services/operations-coordination-and-support/)
about how Ansible roles should be developed. It's raisons d'etre are:

- **Improve peer review**: discuss issues of style out-of-band so that when it
  comes to peer review of pull requests, there is an unambiguous reference.
  This will help **speed up** peer review, and make it **more attractive** for
  repository maintainers to actually conduct such peer review.
  Further it will **encourage contributors**, providing better transparency in
  the process, and allowing discussion around the style guide itself.
