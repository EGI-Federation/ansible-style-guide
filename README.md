[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/EGI-Foundation/ansible-style-guide.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/EGI-Foundation/ansible-style-guide) [![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/f92ace02a15c3ecd758e/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/EGI-Foundation/ansible-style-guide/maintainability)

## Usage

This repository contains style guide for EGI's use of Ansible.
It will

- Generate _styling_ üèÑüèæ Ansible roles, all dressed up and ready to roll üëó using a [sweet skeleton](egi-galaxy-template)
- Pass an expert eye over your code, applying the [Ansible Fashion Police  :policeman: compliance profile](ansible-fashion-police), to help you stick with the style guide as you code.

See the [**quickstart**](docs/Usage.md) if you're just _super_ keen üòç.


See [EGI's roles on Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/EGI-Foundation).
You can find guides on:

- [Ansible syntax in roles](docs/AnsibleSyntax.md)
- [Testing role scenarios, testing tools](docs/Testing.md)

- [Collaborating with code](docs/git.md)

## Motivation

EGI is responsible for several [internal services](https://www.egi.eu/internal-services) either directly, or through collaboration with partners.
Ansible roles are a simple, powerful way to express the desired state and composition of these services.
As with many languages and tools, a certain amount of leeway is possible when it comes to the style of implementation.
When working on roles, it's a good idea to have common nomenclature,
follow common styles and adopt common practice regarding documentation,
community engagement, maintenance, support, _etc_.
With this repository, we express the consensus view of the [EGI Operations team](https://www.egi.eu/internal-services/operations-coordination-and-support/)
about how Ansible roles should be developed. It's raisons d'etre are:

- **Improve peer review**: discuss issues of style out-of-band so that when it
  comes to peer review of pull requests, there is an unambiguous reference.
  This will help **speed up** peer review, and make it **more attractive** for
  repository maintainers to actually conduct such peer review.
  Further it will **encourage contributors**, providing better transparency in
  the process, and allowing discussion around the style guide itself.

- **Improve reliability,  test coverage**: Ansible roles can and should be _tested_ according to common profiles.
  Infrastructure tests can be expressed in plain language, easy to read, and easy to audit.
  Test coverage and profiles can be harmonised across roles so that they can be applied modularly with confidence.

- **Promote re-use**: Roles can only be re-used if they are reliable and deliver what they claim to.
  If, through the points above, we can improve the re-use of these roles, we can avoid dispersion of effort and even better, start to give proper recognition to the authors and peer reviewers of roles.

All in all, we have a more robust infrastructure, less toil and better collaboration.
