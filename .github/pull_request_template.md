  - this repository is the consensus opinion of the EGI Operations team;
    it's ok to disagree, we welcome other styles, but reserve the right to
    stick by ours.
  - This repository contains little code and more documentation.
    As such, issues are sometimes a matter of opinion.
    Please bear this mind when opening an issue, and if possible, describe
